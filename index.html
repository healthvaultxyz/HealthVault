              I was engaged to design and build a website intended to be shown
              to investors. I delivered the requested work. I was not paid for
              that work.
            </p>
            <p>
              Based on my experience during and after the engagement, the
              "Healthvault" project did not correspond to what was represented
              to me. Anyone considering involvement should independently verify
              any claims and materials.
